  <p>In 2023, U.S. companies dumped <strong>$900 billion into stock buybacks</strong>—more than they spent on wages or R&amp;D combined. At their core, a <strong>stock buyback</strong> happens when a company <strong>uses its own money to repurchase shares from the stock market</strong>, reducing the number of outstanding shares. This benefits existing shareholders by <strong>increasing the value of the remaining shares</strong>, making it a common strategy for corporations looking to boost stock prices.</p>
<p>But while some argue that buybacks <strong>stabilize stock prices and return value to investors</strong>, others see them as <strong>a legalized form of market manipulation</strong>, disproportionately benefiting <strong>executives and wealthy shareholders</strong> while diverting money that <strong>could be spent on wages, R&amp;D, or long-term growth.</strong></p>
<p>Initially, I saw <strong>buybacks as a tool of corporate greed</strong>, allowing companies to <strong>artificially inflate stock prices</strong> instead of investing in their businesses. But as I dug deeper, I realized <strong>buybacks aren’t the root problem—they’re a symptom of a broken system that prioritizes short-term stock growth over long-term sustainability.</strong> The problem isn’t that companies <strong>can</strong> do buybacks—the problem is that <strong>they’re rewarded for doing them over everything else.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-historical-shift-buybacks-were-once-illegal"><strong>The Historical Shift: Buybacks Were Once Illegal</strong></h2>
<p>What most people don’t realize is that <strong>buybacks were illegal until 1982</strong>. Under <strong>SEC Rule 10b-18</strong>, corporations were finally allowed to repurchase their own shares without it being considered <strong>stock manipulation</strong>—a change that fundamentally altered how capital was distributed.</p>
<p>Before 1982, excess corporate profits were more likely to be <strong>reinvested into business expansion, wage increases, pensions, and R&amp;D</strong>. After deregulation, <strong>buybacks became a primary tool for returning capital to shareholders</strong>, often at the expense of long-term investment.</p>
<p>The explosion of buybacks in the <strong>1990s and 2000s coincided with stagnating wages and growing income inequality</strong>—a trend that has only accelerated.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-issue-buybacks-fuel-income-inequality"><strong>The Core Issue: Buybacks Fuel Income Inequality</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest flaw in the buyback system is <strong>who benefits.</strong> Proponents claim buybacks <strong>help all investors</strong>—but the reality is that <strong>executives and major shareholders capture the vast majority of the gains</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A 2022 report from the <strong>Economic Policy Institute</strong> found that over <strong>80% of stock buyback gains go to the top 10% of wealth holders, with executives being the primary beneficiaries.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Workers see little to no impact</strong>, as wage growth has remained stagnant despite record-breaking buybacks.</li>
<li><strong>Retail investors (everyday stockholders) don’t gain as much as institutions</strong>, since hedge funds and large shareholders time buyback cycles to maximize their profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, buybacks act as a <strong>wealth transfer mechanism</strong>—redirecting money that <strong>could have been reinvested into the company or workers, however is found in the hands of executives and institutional investors.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-executive-compensation-in-driving-buybacks"><strong>The Role of Executive Compensation in Driving Buybacks</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons buybacks are so heavily used is that <strong>executive pay is directly tied to stock price performance</strong>.</p>
<p>CEOs and corporate leadership often receive <strong>stock options or restricted stock units (RSUs) as their primary form of compensation</strong>, meaning they <strong>personally profit</strong> when the stock price rises.</p>
<p>This creates a clear <strong>conflict of interest</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of focusing on <strong>long-term growth</strong>, executives have an <strong>incentive to pump the stock price in the short term</strong>—even if it comes at the expense of the company’s future.</li>
<li>The easiest way to <strong>boost stock price without actually improving the company?</strong> <strong>Stock buybacks.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s why we see <strong>executives selling off massive amounts of stock immediately after buybacks are announced</strong>—they <strong>engineer a price surge and cash out at the peak.</strong></p>
<p>If we don’t address the <strong>incentive structure</strong> behind executive compensation, <strong>buybacks will continue to be used as a personal payday for corporate leadership.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-role-of-shareholder-pressure--activist-investors"><strong>The Role of Shareholder Pressure &amp; Activist Investors</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest reasons <strong>corporations prioritize stock buybacks</strong> isn’t just executive greed—it’s <strong>pressure from institutional investors and activist hedge funds.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activist investors (e.g., Elliott Management, Carl Icahn) often push companies to buy back shares</strong> instead of reinvesting in their business.</li>
<li><strong>Hedge funds thrive on short-term stock movements</strong> and frequently demand aggressive buyback programs to <strong>boost returns quickly before exiting their positions.</strong></li>
<li>A study from <strong>Harvard Business Review</strong> found that companies targeted by activist investors <strong>increase buybacks by 38%</strong> within two years of shareholder pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases, <strong>corporate leadership isn’t choosing buybacks because they believe it’s best for the company long-term—they’re doing it to keep shareholders happy in the short term.</strong></p>
<p>This reinforces <strong>why tax incentives for long-term reinvestment are necessary</strong>—because as long as Wall Street rewards immediate stock price boosts, companies will keep prioritizing <strong>financial engineering over sustainable growth.</strong></p>
<h2 id="whats-lost-the-opportunity-cost-of-buybacks"><strong>What’s Lost: The Opportunity Cost of Buybacks</strong></h2>
<p>Beyond stock manipulation and income inequality, the <strong>real cost of buybacks is what companies <em>aren’t</em> doing with that money.</strong></p>
<p>Companies that prioritize stock buybacks often <strong>neglect other critical areas</strong>, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>R&amp;D and Innovation:</strong> Many corporations spend <strong>more on buybacks than research &amp; development.</strong> For example, Boeing is often cited as a <strong>cautionary tale of stock buybacks replacing critical reinvestment.</strong> From <strong>2013 to 2019</strong>, Boeing <strong>spent over $43 billion on buybacks</strong>, significantly more than it invested in <strong>R&amp;D and safety improvements</strong> during the same period.</p>
<p>While it would be <strong>oversimplified to blame buybacks alone for the 737 MAX disasters</strong>, critics argue that Boeing <strong>prioritized short-term stock price gains over engineering excellence.</strong> The company cut costs aggressively and <strong>outsourced key software development</strong>—which later contributed to <strong>system failures in the 737 MAX leading to two fatal crashes.</strong></p>
<p>This highlights a key issue: when <strong>executives are financially incentivized to boost stock prices in the short term, long-term priorities like product safety, innovation, and workforce development can take a backseat.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Worker Wages &amp; Benefits:</strong> Despite record profits, many major companies <strong>have not significantly increased wages</strong>, choosing instead to funnel cash into stock repurchases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Business Expansion:</strong> Instead of opening new locations, hiring more workers, or improving infrastructure, companies focus on <strong>financial engineering</strong> to maintain shareholder confidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>From 2010 to 2019, S&amp;P 500 companies spent more money on stock buybacks than they did on capital expenditures and innovation combined.</strong> This means that instead of <strong>building the future</strong>, they’ve been <strong>propping up stock prices.</strong></p>
<h3 id="counterarguments-what-about-companies-that-would-hoard-cash"><strong>Counterarguments: What About Companies That Would Hoard Cash?</strong></h3>
<p>One common argument against restricting buybacks is that <strong>if companies can’t repurchase their stock, they’ll just sit on excess cash instead of reinvesting.</strong></p>
<p>That’s a valid concern, and it’s why <strong>simply banning buybacks wouldn’t work.</strong> If companies aren’t <strong>forced</strong> to reinvest, many will just <strong>hoard capital, distribute it through dividends, or engage in other forms of financial engineering.</strong></p>
<p>That’s why the <strong>solution isn’t banning buybacks—it’s making reinvestment the smarter financial move.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-year tax incentives ensure companies see greater returns from raising wages and funding R&amp;D than from stock repurchases.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Buyback lock-ups don’t ban buybacks—they just prevent insider abuse, keeping them as a tool for legitimate use.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Scaled taxation on buybacks discourages excessive stock repurchases without eliminating them entirely.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This approach <strong>preserves buybacks as a financial tool for stability</strong> while reducing <strong>abuse and short-termism.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-solutions-reforming-buybacks-not-banning-them"><strong>The Solutions: Reforming Buybacks, Not Banning Them</strong></h2>
<p>Originally, I thought banning buybacks was the answer—but that ignores the <strong>root cause</strong> of why they happen in the first place. Instead, I now believe the best approach is <strong>reforming the way buybacks are used while incentivizing companies to reinvest in workers and growth.</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-buyback-lock-up-period-6-12-months"><strong>1. Buyback Lock-Up Period (6-12 Months)</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Executives should be banned from selling stock for 6-12 months after a buyback.</strong></li>
<li>This prevents <strong>pump-and-dump behavior</strong>, where leadership <strong>artificially inflates stock prices and immediately cashes out.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-scaled-taxation-on-buybacks"><strong>2. Scaled Taxation on Buybacks</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Large corporations should <strong>pay a higher tax on buybacks</strong>, while smaller businesses should face lower rates.</li>
<li>This discourages <strong>massive buyback cycles</strong> while ensuring companies can still use them <strong>when necessary.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-multi-year-reinvestment-tax-breaks"><strong>3. Multi-Year Reinvestment Tax Breaks</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Companies that <strong>increase worker wages, expand benefits, or invest in safety improvements</strong> should receive <strong>tax credits that increase over time (50% → 125% → 175%).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Companies that cut wages or benefits after taking the tax break must repay it in full.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-domestic-investment-multiplier"><strong>4. Domestic Investment Multiplier</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Companies that <strong>keep at least 80% of their workforce in the U.S.</strong> receive an <strong>extra multiplier on tax breaks.</strong></li>
<li>This prevents the incentive from <strong>pushing companies to offshore jobs instead of reinvesting domestically.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-alternative-global-approaches"><strong>5. Alternative Global Approaches</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>EU requires shareholder approval for stock buybacks</strong>, giving investors more control.</li>
<li><strong>Japan limits buybacks to 25% of total shares</strong>, ensuring they don’t become the dominant form of capital distribution.</li>
<li>The <strong>U.S. could implement similar policies</strong> to prevent buybacks from overshadowing R&amp;D, wages, and infrastructure investment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts-fixing-the-market-not-just-buybacks"><strong>Final Thoughts: Fixing the Market, Not Just Buybacks</strong></h2>
<p>I started out thinking <strong>buybacks were the problem</strong>, but I now see them as <strong>a symptom of a financial system that rewards short-term gains over long-term stability.</strong></p>
<p>✔ <strong>Executives are financially incentivized to manipulate stock prices</strong> through buybacks.<br>
✔ <strong>Shareholder pressure forces companies to prioritize stock growth over reinvestment.</strong><br>
✔ <strong>Workers and long-term investments get left behind because they don’t provide immediate returns.</strong></p>
<p>If we want real change, <strong>we can’t just ban buybacks—we have to fix the incentives that drive them.</strong></p>
<p>That means <strong>restricting executive sell-offs, taxing reckless buybacks, and making real investment in workers and innovation the more profitable choice.</strong></p>
<p>Until then, <strong>buybacks will remain the stock market’s legal cheat code—rewarding the few at the expense of everyone else.</strong></p>
