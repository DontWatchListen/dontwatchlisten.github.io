      <h1 id="the-social-security-fairness-act-ssfa-was-never-about-fairness"><strong>The Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA) Was Never About Fairness</strong></h1>
<p>When <strong>President Joe Biden signed the Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA) on January 5, 2025</strong>, I bought the pitch for a minute: fix what many saw as an unfair system. The repeal of the <strong>Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO)</strong> meant that <strong>public-sector retirees—teachers, firefighters, and police officers—would no longer see their Social Security benefits reduced because they also had government pensions</strong>.</p>
<p>Supporters framed it as long-overdue justice, correcting a system that had penalized public employees for decades. But here’s the problem: <strong>fixing one unfairness doesn’t mean you don’t create another in its place</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>SSFA expands Social Security benefits dramatically without addressing how to fund them</strong>. The biggest winners are public pensioners in states with large pension systems like <strong>California and Texas</strong>—while <strong>private-sector workers, low-income retirees, and rural communities see nothing but a faster path to insolvency</strong>. And Biden signed it <strong>weeks before leaving office</strong>, making it the <strong>next administration’s problem to clean up</strong>.</p>
<p>The result? A <strong>financially reckless move</strong> that could accelerate <strong>across-the-board benefit cuts for everyone</strong>—including the poorest Social Security recipients—by <strong>2034 instead of 2035</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-social-security-and-who-does-it-serve"><strong>What Is Social Security and Who Does It Serve?</strong></h3>
<p>Social Security is a <strong>federally run program</strong> designed to provide <strong>financial support</strong> to Americans who are <strong>retired, disabled, or survivors of deceased workers</strong>. It operates on a <strong>pay-as-you-go system</strong>, meaning that <strong>current workers&rsquo; payroll taxes fund benefits for today&rsquo;s retirees</strong>. In turn, when these workers retire, <strong>their benefits will be paid by the next generation of workers</strong>.</p>
<p>There are <strong>three primary groups</strong> who rely on Social Security:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Retirees</strong> – Workers who paid into the system for <strong>at least 10 years</strong> (earning at least 40 work credits) can start collecting <strong>monthly retirement benefits</strong> based on their highest <strong>35 years of earnings</strong>. For many, this is <strong>their main or only source of income</strong> in retirement.</li>
<li><strong>Disabled Individuals</strong> – The <strong>Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)</strong> program provides benefits to <strong>workers who become disabled before retirement age</strong> and can no longer work.</li>
<li><strong>Survivors and Dependents</strong> – Spouses, children, and sometimes even parents of deceased workers <strong>receive survivor benefits</strong> to help maintain financial stability after the loss of a family member.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Social Security is not a welfare program, but it also isn&rsquo;t a personal savings account.</strong> It operates as a <strong>pay-as-you-go system</strong>, where today’s workers fund benefits for current retirees, disabled Americans, and survivors. While benefits are <strong>based on earnings history</strong>, they are not tied directly to what an individual contributed—<strong>Social Security is structured to favor lower earners</strong>, ensuring they receive a <strong>higher percentage of their pre-retirement income</strong> than wealthier workers.</p>
<p>That’s why the insolvency crisis matters so much. If the trust fund runs out, <strong>Social Security will still collect payroll taxes</strong>, but it won’t be enough to pay full benefits. This means every recipient—whether a retired worker, disabled individual, or widow—<strong>would see an automatic 23% cut unless Congress steps in with a solution</strong>. The people most affected wouldn’t be those with public pensions or other savings, but <strong>low-income retirees and those who rely entirely on Social Security to survive</strong>.</p>
<p>And <strong>unlike public pensions</strong>, Social Security is <strong>the primary safety net for lower-income workers who don’t have other retirement savings</strong>. That’s why the SSFA’s impact is so lopsided—it <strong>enhances benefits for pensioned workers while worsening the financial outlook for everyone else.</strong></p>
<h3 id="what-the-ssfa-actually-does-and-why-it-matters"><strong>What the SSFA Actually Does and Why It Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Before the SSFA, <strong>WEP and GPO were designed to prevent “double-dipping.”</strong> WEP reduced Social Security benefits for workers who had <strong>both a government pension and a Social Security-covered job</strong>, ensuring that benefits reflected actual Social Security contributions. GPO limited how much a <strong>spouse or widow</strong> could claim in Social Security benefits <strong>if they were already receiving a large public pension</strong>. These provisions weren’t arbitrary—they <strong>prevented a scenario where a public worker could collect both a large pension and full Social Security benefits despite contributing far less to the system</strong>.</p>
<p>The SSFA <strong>wipes those restrictions out</strong>. Now, a public retiree <strong>can collect both full Social Security and a state pension, even if they only paid into Social Security for a fraction of their career</strong>. This disproportionately benefits <strong>high-pension states</strong> while doing <strong>nothing for private-sector retirees or low-income Social Security recipients</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s not an opinion—it’s baked into the numbers.</p>
<h3 id="the-immediate-costs-a-75-billion-giveaway-with-no-offsetting-revenue"><strong>The Immediate Costs: A $7.5 Billion Giveaway with No Offsetting Revenue</strong></h3>
<p>Within two months of the law passing, the <strong>Social Security Administration (SSA) had already issued $7.5 billion in back payments</strong> to affected retirees, with <strong>each individual receiving an average of $6,710</strong>. On top of that, the <strong>average Social Security check for public retirees will rise by $360 per month by the end of 2025</strong>, climbing to <strong>$460 by 2033</strong>. Spouses and widows will see <strong>even higher payouts</strong>, in some cases adding <strong>$700 to $1,190 per month</strong>.</p>
<p>Compare that to the <strong>$800 million in projected savings</strong> from SSA office closures and layoffs. The math doesn’t work. The <strong>entire cost of the law over the next decade is expected to reach $195 billion</strong>—yet there was <strong>zero effort to fund it.</strong> That money has to come from somewhere, and right now, the only answer is <strong>draining Social Security faster</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="why-it-hits-some-states-harder-than-others"><strong>Why It Hits Some States Harder Than Others</strong></h3>
<p>Not every state wins under this law. In fact, some get hit harder than others, particularly <strong>the South and rural states with lower public pensions and fewer Social Security resources</strong>.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Alabama, Mississippi, and West Virginia</strong>, where a <strong>higher percentage of retirees rely entirely on Social Security</strong> because public pensions aren’t as widespread. These states are also home to <strong>many of the SSA office closures</strong>, meaning people who rely on in-person services for disability or retirement claims are being forced to travel <strong>50 to 100 miles</strong> just to get basic assistance.</p>
<p>At the same time, the biggest windfall from the SSFA is <strong>flowing to places like California and Texas</strong>, where <strong>public pensions routinely exceed $4,000 per month</strong>—now with <strong>full Social Security benefits stacked on top</strong>. Meanwhile, a private-sector retiree in those same states <strong>still gets the standard $1,800 average Social Security check, with no boost at all</strong>.</p>
<p>If fairness was the goal, <strong>this law fails over half the country.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the-long-term-fallout-insolvency-just-got-closer"><strong>The Long-Term Fallout: Insolvency Just Got Closer</strong></h3>
<p>Even before the SSFA, Social Security was on track to <strong>run out of full funding by 2035</strong>, at which point benefits would be <strong>automatically cut by 23%</strong> unless Congress took action. Now, with <strong>an additional $195 billion in obligations</strong>, insolvency is projected to arrive <strong>a year earlier, in 2034</strong>.</p>
<p>That means that without additional revenue, <strong>every retiree, disabled individual, and survivor collecting Social Security will see an immediate 23% reduction in benefits</strong>. That’s not speculation—that’s the built-in function of Social Security once the trust fund is depleted.</p>
<p>For a wealthy California public worker with a <strong>$4,500 pension and full Social Security benefits</strong>, that 23% cut might be frustrating, but not life-altering. For a <strong>rural Alabama widow living on $1,300 a month</strong>, it’s the difference between making rent or not.</p>
<p>The SSFA <strong>isn’t just a financial misstep—it’s actively making the program less stable for those who need it most</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="a-political-handoff-with-no-accountability"><strong>A Political Handoff with No Accountability</strong></h3>
<p>Perhaps the <strong>most calculated part</strong> of this entire move is <strong>the timing</strong>. Biden <strong>signed this law on January 5, 2025</strong>—weeks before leaving office. That means the <strong>Trump administration</strong> now has to <strong>deal with the funding crisis</strong> and either find a solution or be blamed for “cutting benefits.”</p>
<p>By locking in this law <strong>without a funding plan</strong>, Biden ensured that the next administration <strong>would either have to cut somewhere else, raise taxes, or let insolvency hit faster</strong>. And when that happens, the political narrative will be <strong>&ldquo;Trump cut Social Security&rdquo;</strong>—even though the real issue is that <strong>there was never a plan to fund this expansion in the first place</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s not responsible governance. That’s <strong>a political time bomb</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-could-have-been-done-differently"><strong>What Could Have Been Done Differently?</strong></h3>
<p>If fixing WEP and GPO was truly the goal, there were <strong>smarter ways to do it</strong> that wouldn’t have pushed Social Security closer to collapse. Some options could have included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raising the taxable earnings cap</strong> (right now, only the first <strong>$176,100 of income is taxed</strong> for Social Security—removing that cap would solve the insolvency issue entirely).</li>
<li><strong>Phasing in benefit increases more gradually</strong> to avoid a $7.5 billion lump sum drain.</li>
<li><strong>Capping full Social Security benefits for high-income pensioners</strong> rather than giving them the same expansion as lower-income public retirees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, Congress <strong>chose the most expensive, least sustainable path</strong>—and left the bill for someone else to handle.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion-this-is-a-retirement-crisis-in-the-making"><strong>Conclusion: This Is a Retirement Crisis in the Making</strong></h1>
<p>The Social Security Fairness Act <strong>was marketed as a fix for public employees</strong>, but in reality, it <strong>created a new inequity while making Social Security even more fragile</strong>.</p>
<p>The biggest winners are <strong>public pensioners in states with generous benefits</strong>, while <strong>low-income Social Security recipients, private-sector retirees, and the rural poor will suffer the most when insolvency hits a year sooner</strong>. And Biden <strong>signed this law knowing full well it would create a funding crisis</strong>—one that <strong>Trump’s administration will now be forced to clean up</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: <strong>by 2034, if nothing changes, every Social Security recipient will face a 23% cut.</strong> And <strong>that’s the real legacy of this bill.</strong></p>
